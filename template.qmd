# Main Topic

## sub-topic1

You can create new slides by using \#\# and then giving the title of the slide. If you only use one \# it will create the Main Topic slide you saw before this. The text does not resize to the slide so make sure all the text you want on a slide fits on there.

## Reference example

You can use references if you want using the BibTeX file specified under bibliography. @quarto-website. You can also use hyperlinks [https://quarto.org/](click here for the quarto website)

## Table Example

Making tables in quarto is quite simple

| This | Is | an | Example | Table | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5 | 1 | hello | x | 2.6633 |
| 0.2 | 5 | goodbye | y | 6.4239 | 

## Formula Example

Inserting formulas in the text is the same as it would be in latex: $y = X\beta + \epsilon$
$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty a(r)^{n-1} = \frac{a}{1-r} \text{ if and only if } -1 < r < 1$$

## Figure Example

![Amazing Organization](example_image.png)

## Bullets example

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code example

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can also display code on the slide by setting echo to True

```{r, echo=T}
1 + 1
```

You can also run the code within your RStudio by clicking the play button in Rstudio or the run cell button in VScode (provided you installed the quarto plugin)
